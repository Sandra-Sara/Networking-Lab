Client-Server Networks - Computer Science GCSE GURU
A client-server network is a computing model where multiple clients (devices, programs) access resources and services from a central server. The server manages these resources and provides them to the clients. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Clients:
These are the devices or programs that request information or services from the server. Examples include web browsers, email clients, or application software. 
Server:
This is the central computer that stores and manages the resources (like files, applications, or data) that clients need. 
Network:
The clients and the server are connected through a network, which can be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or even the internet. 
Resource Sharing:
The server acts as a central hub for resource sharing, allowing multiple clients to access the same data or services. 
Centralized Management:
Client-server networks offer the advantage of centralized management of applications and data, which simplifies administration and maintenance. 
How it works: 
A client sends a request to the server for a specific resource or service.
The server receives the request and processes it.
The server then sends the requested resource or service back to the client.
Common examples:
Web Browsing:
When you visit a website, your web browser (the client) sends a request to the web server, which then sends back the website content. 
Email:
Email clients (like Outlook) are the clients that connect to mail servers to send and receive emails. 
File Sharing:
Networked drives or shared folders on a server allow multiple users to access and share files.
